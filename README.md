# List_Links
A software made to save a bunch of links with a common "subject" you usually open altogether. Made with Kivy.

Want to contribute? 
Here are the tasks for next release:
  - When I open a folder, a list of links is recovered from a file and sent to a new page
  - Write Tests for everything coming next.
  - Modify ListScreen UI for be at least, less awful.
