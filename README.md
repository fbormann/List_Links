# List_Links
A software made to save a bunch of links with a common core "subject" you usually open altogether. Made with Kivy.

Want to contribute? 
Here are the tasks for next release:
  - Store list of items in a persistent json file.
  - When I create a item on folders, it actually creates a folder on the system folder.
  - When I open a folder, a list of links is recovered from a file
  - Write Tests for everything coming next.
