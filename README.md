# List_Links
A software made to save a bunch of links with a common "subject" you usually open altogether. Made with Kivy.

Want to contribute? 
Here are the tasks for next release:
	- write test for a kivy functionality.
	- Try to make the main screen prettier, design the sketches and try to test them out first.
  - When I create a item on folders, it actually creates a folder on the system folder (Right now it's only JSON)
  - FOR GUI GUIDANCE we are using this repository: https://github.com/mvasilkov/kivy-2014
  - Write Tests for everything coming next.
  - Modify ListScreen UI for be at least, less awful.
